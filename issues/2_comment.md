The problem was that the main JavaScript class ImageCompressor, which contains all logic for file input, drag-and-drop, and browse, was never instantiated. Without instantiation, event listeners were not bound, so the file input area did not respond. I fixed this by adding:

```
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    new ImageCompressor();
});
```

This ensures that the class is initialized after the DOM is loaded, so all event listeners are bound and file input works as expected.
